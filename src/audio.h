// Tiny wav playback layer on top of SDL3's built-in audio. No SDL_mixer or
// other extension is used.
//
// Model:
//   * sfx_load() decodes a .wav once via SDL_LoadWAV; PCM is cached in Sfx.
//   * audio_init() opens a fixed pool of SDL_AudioStreams, each bound to the
//     default playback device. SDL sums their output automatically, so the
//     pool gives us cheap polyphony without writing a mixer.
//   * sfx_play() picks a free voice (or steals one) and queues the cached
//     PCM into it. SDL's audio thread pulls it out on its own.
//
// Current limitations (intentionally small surface; expand when needed):
//   * Voice pool is fixed-size (AUDIO_VOICE_COUNT). When every voice is in
//     use, sfx_play() steals the voice with the most data still queued and
//     cuts off whatever was playing on it.
//   * No looping, no per-voice pitch shifting, no positional / 3D audio.
//   * No streaming: the entire decoded PCM is held in memory per Sfx.
//   * No master/bus volume -- only the per-call `volume` gain.
//   * No hot-reload: replacing a wav on disk requires sfx_free + sfx_load.
//   * Device is opened once at audio_init(); device hot-swap (e.g. user
//     plugging in headphones at runtime) is not handled.
